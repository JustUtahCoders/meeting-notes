talked about feedback from david on docket reminder

talked about expungements
- we should have i18n in mind when we write the code
- once we have all the content, then we can approach a designer
    - Carly Moore
    - think about other designers?
    - student at dev mountain towards the end of their course, wanting to build out their portfolio?
- what's our vision for the site?
    - two calls to action: what is an expungement? start an expungement
    - left hand menu with 9 steps listed out, click on each one to get content
    - i18n controls
    - how to make it open source so others can edit
        - simple react components, markdown
- Bret - maybe figure out some i18n stuff
- doing expungements
    - one of the most important things is helping them fill out documents
        - itext - backend, license
        - not many open source tools to edit PDF
        - Joel's idea: 
            - we do a one-time conversion from PDF to SVG with some free tool, then render the SVG in the browser and place absolute-positioned fields, then try to get the browser to print it as separate 8.5x11 pages still
            - instructing users to print, and teaching them to save as PDF instead
            - this requires zero backend
            - can we create an 8.5x11 svg that prints correctly
    - good place to start is eligibility wizard
    - lookup/scrape data, iframe
        - more accurate than self-reported
        - account to do the lookup = money to sign up, and then money to do the lookup
    - navigation within expungement tool - sidebar

Bret: look into internationalization and content
Luke: look into the logic for eligibility and start on the self-reporting tool

Docket reminder

Joel: working on getting the updated code into GitLab and getting SMS unsubscribe to work
Leah: working on form validation -- required fields and valid phone and email, Email unsubscribe page

Progress!
- updated code is in GitLab
- you can now unsubscribe from SMS
- form validation: email or phone is required, email must be valid format, phone must be valid US format
- unsubscribe page is built that clears out user's email address (note: this is for ALL alerts, maybe want to revisit this if someone wants to unsubscribe from one particular case number?)
