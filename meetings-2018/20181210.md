## Leah's update:

I'm done for the night, but here is my update. I made all the updates to the form in the client alert stuff - justice/district radio, county dropdown, and filtered court location (city) dropdown. I haven't yet updated the script on the backend to actually respect this stuff when sending the notifications, so that'll have to wait. You can see the new signup page here: https://docketreminder.com/clientalert/
