- Replied to Tucker's email with some more questions. Also invited Tucker to meet with us next week

- @Luke made the contributors page fancier. It now looks really nice.

- Ryan and I talked about the data model with person objects and case objects. And what data should be stored on which object. Also if we should even store credit card info on those things.

- I started work on the Motion to Waive Fees form

- I fixed a problem where print emulation in chrome dev tools looked weird

- Switched over to saving data to firebase once an input blurs.

- Switched over to in-memory answers being saved between forms (as long as you don't leave the app or refresh the page)

- Ryan and I got talking about bootcamps and bootcamp grads and businesses and hiring processes. It was fun :smile:
