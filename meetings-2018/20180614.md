we got zupas again, leah got a mixture of cauliflower and tomato soup and it was better this time. also the strawberry was extra good, i think they're in season right now

how do we get more people to come
- we invited more people and followed up with people we have talked to previously

let's talk about the salt lake county thing briefly
- expungement screening tool
- Noella Sudbury - senior policy advisor - introduced us to Tucker Samuelson, the technical person
- they had an expungement day, and he helped her with the project
- expungement screening, and a tool to help prepare documents
    - once they think they qualify for an expungement, a tool to help them fill out the necessary paperwork
    - help people who could have their record expunged
- ideology: help people get their records expunged
    - justice system should be about rehabilitation, but a criminal record can set you back in a big way. and if the legal system allows expungement, then it should be an easy process that should be accessible to everyone

let's figure out the docket reminder stuff
- we still don't have a bluehost login
- we have their full database! yay!
- implementation
    - bluehost + WP
    - AWS + WP
    - AWS + not wordpress
- david and seth would consider switching from bluehost, but they like wordpress

OKAY LET'S WORK ON THE DOCKET REMINDER PROJECT
- we logged into the wordpress site and poked around the contact forms
- we figured out a way to get the contact form data to populate a database
- we adjusted the client alert form to be exactly what David told us - including terms and conditions
- we spent some time trying to import the 13GB SQL dump onto our local machines so we could start experimenting with queries
    - joel ran out of disk space and deleted GarageBand (RIP)
    - we learned about the "source" command in mysql
    - we figured out how to do it but it took 5ever
