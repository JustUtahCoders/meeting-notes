## Leah's update:

I've been working on making some changes to the signup form for client court reminders on docketreminder.com. The main thing was to distinguish the case by court county/location. Last week I added those controls, but unfortunately this week as I started trying to make the backend changes, I realized there are problems with the way I was doing it. I was using "conditional groups" in the Wordpress plugin Contact Form 7 to render the dropdowns with the locations for each county. But it turns out the dropdowns are still _rendered_, just not visible -- a distinction that is important when it comes to the data that actually gets saved for the conditional dropdown (location). Anyway, I tried a few different solutions and none of them were working, so I decided to just write my own javascript to dynamically change the location dropdown when a county is picked. You can see that code here: https://gitlab.com/anitracks/courtclientalert/commit/5dc1251c3f512a4fde95b41a02bb0b7655e7b148. I'd be happy to answer any other questions too. Now the data is all being stored perfectly and I feel optimistic that the changes in the script on the backend will be quick and easy. (I may do them tonight, just wanted to write this down before I moved on.)

## tl;dr 
I wrote this code: https://gitlab.com/anitracks/courtclientalert/commit/5dc1251c3f512a4fde95b41a02bb0b7655e7b148
