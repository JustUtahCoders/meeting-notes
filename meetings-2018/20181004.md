Notes from meeting with Hollee for expungement clinic:

Affidavit - Would be nice to have the heading
Order Form would be nice to have done as soon as possible

We found out that it would be nice to have information from 
https://bci.utah.gov/criminal-records/obtain-a-copy-of-your-own-criminal-history-record/
before candidates come in for screening. This process to get a preliminary screening costs 15$ and will be a 'Better' check than self selecting.

Hollee mentioned that most candidates have trouble self reporting on their convictions, either they're embarrassed or they don't know, but the best way to get the correct screening from them is to have them get their BCI Criminal History report generated. They can use that report for filling out info on our site.

After the letter from BCI is dated and signed, eligible candidates have 90Days to get their case put together and filed. 

Next course of action: Finish the Motion, then work on the Affidavit.
