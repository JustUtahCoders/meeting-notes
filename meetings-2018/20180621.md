JUSTIN IS HERE IT'S NOT A JOEL/LEAH ECHO CHAMBER ANYMORE

Expungements
- data for any conviction is public
    - have to get an account, get approved, then pay per search
- we went over the guidelines for eligibility and an overview of the expungement process
- tucker's dream is to have an expungement software tool and then contact the people in the database
    - 1/3 of convictions in his database are eligible to be expunged
    - most people don't get a lawyer for this process, and most people can't figure out the process, many don't know it's even possible
- tucker has an excel spreadsheet calculator with a sample of 1000, 320 are eligible
- idea for web app
    - there's a department of the court that builds a tool that allows you to fill out paperwork for the court, but they don't do expungements
        - if we can get with them and build it, it would be best
    - utah legal services - nonprofit - we could get them to host it, they've already got a website and a reputation
    - or, we could build our own
        - we can always do this at first and then move it over
        - two major aspects:
            - screening tool
            - paperwork
        - maybe we can start with the basic:
            - website with static content w/ 8 step process
            - slowly replace each step with tools
        - fill out forms
            - PDFs - potentially 65 documents per case
- technical details
    - login makes sense bc it's an 18 month process, gotta keep track of progress. but, the purpose is to remove all trace of your crime, so we should probably be aware of data security
    - maybe even login for static content so they can "check things off" like a to do list
- let's:
    - decide a name / domain
        - utahexpungements.com
    - create an AWS account and make preliminary tech stack decisions
    - maybe we can use github pages
        - with a custom domain

Justin had to leave, now it's a Joel/Leah echo chamber again

Smashburger breakkkkkkkk

Docket reminder project
- investigated the database
- everything looks manageable
- we wrote a python script that queried for the notifications and it's working! bc we are python and mysql GENIUSES
