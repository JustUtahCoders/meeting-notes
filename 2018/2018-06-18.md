# 6/18/18 - Volunteer Group Meeting

## Update from Joel:

*"I met with Tucker Samuelsen, who works for Noella Sudbury the Senior Policy Advisor on Criminal Justice for Salt Lake County, earlier this week about a new project for us to work on. The project is related to making it easier for people with criminal records to go through the legal process of getting their convictions expunged so that they won’t fail background checks when applying for jobs, housing, or government assistance.*

*It turns out that about a third of convictions on record haven’t been expunged yet, but could be. This ranges from felonies to misdemeanors to infractions. And the process for doing so is really convoluted (10+ pages of legal documents), takes about 18 months, and costs about $650 per conviction.*

*Tucker pointed out to me that as technology has improved in the last 30 years, one’s criminal record is becoming more and more accessible to employers and landowners, but that the technology to help the lay person expunge their record hasn’t really kept up. As a result, there are a lot of people who are essentially unemployable.*

*Anyway, enough soap boxing -- let’s talk some details. We are going to **build a website** that educates people on what expungements are and how to do them, then helps them know if their specific convictions qualify for expungement, and then helps them fill out the paperwork and instructs them how to file the paperwork.*

*We are not going to build all of that at once. Instead, we’ll start just with the part that helps people fill out the paperwork and expand from there. And we’ll work with Tucker, Noella, and the lawyers at Utah Legal Services (who provide free expungement legal aid) to make sure that we get it right and that people are aware that it exists."*
