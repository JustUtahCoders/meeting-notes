# 6/7/18 - Wow it's our first meeting!

Ate Zupas. Soup was pretty good. Joel agrees.

Discussed the Docket Reminder project 

(docketreminder.com) 

---

Reviewed the two goals of the project:

    1. Create a page on the Wordpress site to automate sign up for clients

        * signup form with case number, name, email/phone so client can get notified about scheduled court appearance

    2. Automate the scraping/notification process with a cron job?

        * Progress is blocked because we don't have access to the database or hosting

        * Discussed rebuilding the site in a new stack if David & Seth are interested
            
        * Decided we should invite David to our meetings to get some more direction and make progress
