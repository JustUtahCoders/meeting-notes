Update from talking with Tucker:

Apologies for the slow response. That's interesting that attorneys have a special way to file documents that isn't accessible to the public. That gives us good direction on what to focus on.

Updates:

We're still building out the petition for conviction for and will move on to the Order, Request to Submit, and Fee Waiver forms.

Still working on building out the login experience and persisting/sharing data across forms. We've decided to split up the data into a "person" and a "case," with most of the data stored with the person and applicable to all cases, but some data stored on the case, which will be shared between all forms for the case but not between cases.

Questions:

Did Hollee get back to you?

Any update on if the courts are pursuing building a publicly accessible form filler outer? Or if they'd be interested in consulting with us on it?
Does next Monday work for you to come to one of our meetings? It would be 6:30 in Salt Lake. This week we're at Nostalgia Cafe, but we like hopping around and trying places.

With the Certificate of Eligibility, you explained they send you back a list of all of the things you are eligible to expunge, and you notify them which items on that list you'd like to pay for.  Then they send you the certificates you've requested." Is that back and forth (where you notify them which items on the list you'd like to pay for and then they send certificates) a formal process with forms that are filed? Or is it more informal? Is it via paper letter? In person visit to their office? What's the turnaround on actually getting the certificates? We'd love to see the paperwork from BCI that you mentioned earlier that you could show us.
The petition for expungement must be filled out once per case, right? (https://www.utcourts.gov/howto/expunge/docs/01_Petition_to_Expunge_Records_Criminal-conviction.pdf). And if you were convicted of multiple crimes all during one court proceeding, you would only need to submit one Petition?

Might be a lot to ask, but could you guide us through how someone gets filing fees waived? I've been looking at https://www.utcourts.gov/resources/forms/waiver/, but haven't been able to identify exactly which forms we can suggest getting the filing fees waived. Can this be done for any of the forms?  And https://www.utcourts.gov/resources/forms/waiver/docs/01_Motion_and_Affidavit_to_Waive_Fees.pdf and https://www.utcourts.gov/resources/forms/waiver/docs/02_Financial_Affidavit_Supporting_Motion.pdf.

Joel,

I did talk to Hollee.  She says she's usually really busy during the actual expungement clinics, but she'd be able to talk to you before one.  The next one would be October 4th, and if you could meet up with her around 430-445 or so she'd probably be able to talk.

I've honestly been busy with other projects, so I don't have much update here.  I can talk more about this project next time I see you.

That works!  That's actually pretty close to where I live so I can come by next Monday.
Good question.  It is somewhat formal â€“ they send you basically a checkbox, with instructions on how to pay, so you can put in a credit card number and send it back.  I'm actually not sure what this turnaround time is like.  I can find out!

Yep, you've got it.  If they're convicted of multiple charges on one case, it's usually all counted as the same "criminal episode" so they just need one petition.  It is possible that a criminal episode can contain multiple cases, but that's super rare, and probably not worth worrying about.

I can definitely do that, but it might be something that's best done in person.  So I can walk you through it Monday when I come by.  Does that work?

Hope this helps!
