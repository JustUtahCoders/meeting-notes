# 10/8/2018 - Volunteer Update

## Leah's update:

- Docket reminder is now running a new theme with a child theme and all the custom templates are set up correctly

- The custom templates had to be changed for the new theme, and those were pushed to the gitlab repo

- There are still some issues to work out, but it looks like most of the functionality is restored for client alerts

- I had trouble with FTP access so i literally added a <?php touch(...) ?> script to a page and then VISITED the page exactly once to run the script and create files and then deleted the script lol

## Joel's update:

- I fixed a bug where an extra blank page was being appended to all printed forms in Chrome
