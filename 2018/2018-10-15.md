# 10/15/2018 - Volunteer Update

## Leah's update:

+ goal is to get docket reminder client alerts working again after the switch to Dreamhost

+ the frontend functionality is all good, now just the send-notifications.py script needs to get run on a cron job

+ gave myself a cron refresher

+ confirmed that server is running python 2

+ confirmed that server has the courtclientalert repo cloned and therefore access to the send-notifications.py script

+ in setting up env variables, I realized that the email account we were using to send the notifications no longer exists because it was on Bluehost

+ so now we need to set up an email account using Dreamhost

+ researched email in Dreamhost, I need access to a UI portal which I don't currently have

+ sent David & Seth and email about the UI portal access
