## Go over what we're working on:

### Project 1: notifications for client court appearances

### Project 2: expungement tool
    - write stuff in a way that a layperson can understand

Ashly researched expungement stuff and started writing content for the website

Leah worked on getting Twilio SMS notifications working and refactoring the notification python script

Joel figured out email sending with bluehost, hooked up the user sign up database, and got the code deployed
