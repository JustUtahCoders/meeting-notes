# 6/14/2018 - Volunteer Group Meeting

We got Zupas again, Leah got a mixture of cauliflower and tomato soup and it was better this time. Also the strawberry was extra good, I think they're in season right now.

## How do we get more people to come?

    - We invited more people and followed up with people we have talked to previously

## Let's talk about the salt lake county thing briefly

    - expungement screening tool

    - Noella Sudbury - senior policy advisor - introduced us to Tucker Samuelson, the technical person

    - They had an expungement day, and he helped her with the project

    - Expungement screening, and a tool to help prepare documents
        - Once they think they qualify for an expungement, a tool to help them fill out the necessary paperwork
        - Help people who could have their record expunged

    - Ideology: help people get their records expunged
        - Justice system should be about rehabilitation, but a criminal record can set you back in a big way. and if the legal system allows expungement, then it should be an easy process that should be accessible to everyone

## Let's figure out the docket reminder stuff

    - We still don't have a bluehost login

    - We have their full database! yay!

    - Implementation
        - bluehost + WP
        - AWS + WP
        - AWS + not wordpress

    - David and Seth would consider switching from bluehost, but they like wordpress

## OKAY LET'S WORK ON THE DOCKET REMINDER PROJECT

    - We logged into the wordpress site and poked around the contact forms

    - We figured out a way to get the contact form data to populate a database

    - We adjusted the client alert form to be exactly what David told us - including terms and conditions

    - We spent some time trying to import the 13GB SQL dump onto our local machines so we could start experimenting with queries
        - Joel ran out of disk space and deleted GarageBand (RIP)
        - we learned about the "source" command in mysql
        - we figured out how to do it but it took 5ever
