# 07-22-2019 - Comunidades Unidas Meeting

## Feedback and Requests from staff:
	
	- "The Button" appears to be broken again

	- add seperated as a value for a civil status

	- move history dot to start of log entry instead of middle so it's easier to see what log its related to

	- align voting question in add client in mobile view

	- client visit tracking
		- separate from client notes

	- 211 call tracking
		- they'd like to document how often the 211 system is referring people to them
		- they'd also like to track leads coming from 211 rather than from events

	- reminder to add established goal in the notes and remove separate questions

	- add appointment scheduled date

	- notification for system users for when the system is down for maintence or due to an error

	- leadership meetings need to go under community engagements

	- additional input methods for client interaction times or a dropdown list in half hour increments

	- subtext for add client interactions, client search, and add client notes
		- could be resolved by showing the client id in addition to the name

	- locations list
		- offices
		- affliated organization offices
		- event locations
		- mobile consult locations

	- add ability to search for client by id

	- separate API and second post in interaction to save leads separate

	- maybe add to leads when it is okay to call
		- in lead notes or general data?

	- ability to export data to spreadsheet form
		- salesforce?
		- csv?
		- batch?
		- api?

	- "reporting" spreadsheet export as start point for the reporting phase instead of a full dashboard and viewing page
