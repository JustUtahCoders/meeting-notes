# 2/24/2019 - Volunteers Group Meeting

Joel, Tucker, and I met yesterday and then Joel and I met again today to work on Docket Reminder stuff and a couple other things. 

## Looked into & fixed a couple of Docket Reminder issues:

    * client sign up button was showing an orange-box error the first time clicked. this turned out to be related to a WP plugin called Akismet trying to block spam. we disabled Akismet and made sure ReCAPTCHA was still enabled, and it fixed the issue.

    * case number prefixes -- we were ignoring the three-char prefix before the case number, but we were previously making the (incorrect) assumption that ALL cases in the DB had this prefix. we fixed the code to be more flexible and work for cases with and without prefixes

    * did some database digging because David signed up for an email and never got a notification. turns out the case was in a different city/county than the one he signed up for, that's why there was no notification

## Utah Expungements topics:

    * I gave the flyers to Joel

    * for the lead collections on the main page, we noticed the email notifications weren't working so we redeployed the Firebase Cloud Function and now it works mysteriously

    * we added capturing of the sign up date to the lead collector

    * we fixed a button on the vocab page that was leading to a broken/empty page
