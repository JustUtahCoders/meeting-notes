# 1/19/2019 - Volunteers Group Meeting

Leah finished the docket reminder stuff

Leah and I changed the home page for utahexpungements.org to ask people to sign up for a "beta" and give us their email. The idea is that we can get a list of people who visit our site and see if we can help them more individually.
