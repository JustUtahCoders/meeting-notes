# 08-06-2019 - Volunteer Group Meeting

Introductions.

## Expungements Project Overview

Discussed the issue with the incomplete set up of the implementation of the automated expungements.

Discussed our meeting with the law firm from last week.

### Discussed what expungements are and how they are applicable to citizen's day to day life.

what agencies can and can't see an expungement

difference between expungement and purged record

the basics of the expungement process

---

## Expungement applicant hurdles:

- only about half of the certifications get filed with the court currently

- BCI print out does not include everything on your record

### transportation hurdles

	- cost

	- time

	- access

	- number of places that need to be visited throughout the process

### upfront cost hurdle

	- this isn't cheap

	- fee waiver only goes so far and is a large set of forms itself

	- current process does not let you know the odds of you qualifying until the very end so the money is gone before knowing if you have other costs that need to be covered first

### follow-up receipt hurdle

	- the length of the process leaves those who don't have steady housing or a consistant mailing address unable to continue the process in time

	- it can take 3 to 8 months to receive a response

### Went over our goals for this project to catch up the new members:

	- helping the courts get the auto process actually up and running

	- create a "wizard" to help people see in advance how likely it is they will qualify for an expungement and what they may need to still do to get there

	- autofill the repeat sections of the needed docs

	- step by step guide of what they need to do and help them keep track of their progress

### Fear of going to the required locations

	- applicant may have pending warrents they are unaware of

	- past experiences with the legal system may have created untreated phobic reactions to the locations

## Additional Expungement Project Discussion Points

Discussed where Code for America's ClearMyRecord project is at
*(we're at approximately the same stage currently)*

Prelimiary determination and/or progress instructions could be completely automated along with cost estimations

Cost of accessing the data is a barrier for the project currently

	- $0.50 per search cost
	- Exchange "is not for public use"
	- Technically screen scraping is prohibited but this does not seem to be enforced
		- if we can move forward on a screen scraping tool it will need it's own api for our if else eval to compare against
	
We need labor for the following on this project:

	- coding the forms
	- wizard if else logic
	- exchange screen scraping tool
	- tool for the courts to imporve their process
	- auto fill out forms
	- next action suggester
	- show potient saved we/ the fee wavier
	- fee waiver qualification eval
	- pardons guide

Discussed how Maryland's expungement project was done. They're free and public to search.

The Exchange FTP option doesn't provide info to actually use it.

A person going for the physical copy doesn't have the full Exchange info.
*Is this a violation fo the Freedom of Information Act?*

We can get 200 searched for $30 per month and $0.50 for each search after.

The FTP may get us part of the way there but we will need to disclose in what way we are using the info from it so it's clear that we could be wrong.
*basically a disclosure to clear up that we are not lawyers*

### Compile arguments to appeal for access to the data:

- How this can help the homelessness issues in positive move forward manner.

- How this can help our recovering economy post recesssion left over damages (stats on crimes from the recession compared to local ecomony)

- Way to show how Utah is advancing it's legal system to draw more businesses to the state since more new companies are hyper aware of social and civil issues

- Ways increased expungements could effect state costs
	- reduce labor costs for the courts
	- possible reduction of individuals that are on assistance due to labor and housing restrictions placed on them from having a record
	- decreased unrest with the most at risk citizens by providing a more clear cut and clearly achievable path forward
	- reduce strain on the prison system by reducing re-offendence risks (people who have more employment options are less likely to return to criminal activity)
	- improved mental health of present and past convicted population by removing the sense that one is trapped within the system once in

- Compare forms for all the repeating data

## Additional Discussions

Should we make a guest section in our slack?

Should we make a volunteer eval questionaire to determine if a volunteer is ready and available to dive in on a project. There is a time available restraint on our end for getting new volunteers up to speed on a project.
