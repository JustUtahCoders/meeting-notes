# 2/23/2019 - Volunteers Group Meeting

*Documented on 2/24/2019*

Joel, Tucker, and I met and discussed:

	* talked about possibility of growing a 501(c)(3) nonprofit out of our group

	* Joel updated us on some conversations he'd had with some contacts, and he's meeting with comunidades unidas this week

	* talked about what the "mission statement" would be -- criminal justice related or more general "do-gooding"
	
	* talked about consulting w/ nonprofits vs. more directly helping people
