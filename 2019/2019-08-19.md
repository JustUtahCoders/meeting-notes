# 08-19-2019 - Comunidades Unidas Meeting

Launded Phase II!

## Suggestions

- different background color for client interaction slats for quicker identification between them during entry

- move dots in history to top rather than middle

- add a color key to the history page (and maybe a micro icon for colorblind accessibility)

- for "future proofing" the system, add a way for admins to edit the services/programs list so that a dev isn't needed to update this part of the system

- some sort of confirmation (password or access level required) for deleting client profile

---

## Requests

- fix double click duplication bug

- add interaction id to client log

- save / edit pop-up instead of only a save pop-up
