# 3/9/2019 - Comunidades Unidas Meeting

Joel and Tucker met with Leonel Nieto to further discuss the CRM for Comunidades Unidas. Joel showed him progress on deploying the CRM to AWS via Elastic Beanstalk.

Joel also showed Leonel how to boot up the local environment and create database migrations for it. Next step is to meet again with Luis, Leonel, and Vicky to get Wix access so that we can create a subdomain for the CRM on cuutah.org. Additionally we'll need a CU account on AWS for billing.
