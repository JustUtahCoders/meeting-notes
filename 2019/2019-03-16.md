# 3/16/2019 - Expungements Project Meeting

Leah and Tucker met at Nostalgia to talk about content/videos/help guides. We determined a good place to start would be a high-level video helping people read and understand their BCI Criminal History printout. We wrote a first draft for that video.

We also talked about providing transcripts / "blog post" like articles with each video.
