# 3/12/2019 - Comunidades Unidas Meeting

Joel met with Luis, Vicky, and Leonel at Comunidades Unidas for an hour and a half. They gave us access to their AWS and Wix accounts and we discussed the project further. Was a very exciting meeting, we are narrowing in on scope, documenting bugs, and getting closer to getting this thing usable. We also discussed authentication and roles/permissions.
