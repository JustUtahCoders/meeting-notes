# 2/4/2019 - Volunteers Group Meeting

Leah and Tucker met with David McNeill and a group at the SLC justice court with Judge Landau about the Docket Reminder court appearance notification system:

Update on the meeting w/ Judge Landau and his group -- we showed them the docket reminder system for clients, talked about existing notification system efforts that have been made. A LOT of useful info gathered there, it was amazing. I'll paste my notes in here after this. We ended with basically a decision that they are going to create business cards with the URL and hand them out with ppl's paperwork as they're leaving the court, and they'll also make some announcements and tell people while they're waiting, etc. Super exciting! We are set to meet again in two weeks and the changes made by then will be: 

	1) create a specific signup page for SLC Justice court so people don't have to choose the stuff from the dropdown that might be confusing, 

	2) add the judge's name to the notification, and 

	3) (maybe) do some basic validation on the case number to check if it's in our system when they're signing up.
