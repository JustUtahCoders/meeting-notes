# 2/27/2019 - Comunidades Unidas Meeting

Joel met with Luis Garza and Vicky Fuentes at Comunidades Unidas. It was decided that we would help build a CRM for Comunidades Unidas, starting with a client intake form.

The purpose of the CRM will be to organize information and to be able to report on what services Comunidades is providing to donors. 

Next step is to meet with Leonel Nieto, who is a board member at CU who is fairly technical and has already started work on a database schema.
