# 3/24/2019 - Comunidades Unidas Meeting

Joel and Leonel met at Nostalgia to get Leonel's local development environment up and running and working for comunidades unidas. Also to teach him how to make backend API endpoints with Express.

The site https://database.cuutah.org is up and running, deployed via Travis to AWS Elastic Beanstalk! We also scheduled a meeting with Luis and Vicky for this week to discuss what we will
initially ship with.
